# Introduction

SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.

## Why do we need SQL?

- To do CRUD operations on databases
- To create and modify databases
- To retrieve data from databases
- To manage databases

## What is SQL?

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.

## Difference between SQL and MySQL

## Difference between SQL and NoSQL

| SQL                                                         | NoSQL                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SQL databases are **relational databases**.                 | NoSQL databases are **non-relational databases**.                                               |
| SQL databases use **structured query language**.            | NoSQL databases use **unstructured query language**.                                            |
| SQL databases are **table-based** databases.                | NoSQL databases are **document-based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores.** |
| SQL databases are **vertically scalable**.                  | NoSQL databases are **horizontally scalable**.                                                  |
| SQL databases are not suited for hierarchical data storage. | NoSQL databases are well suited for hierarchical data storage.                                  |

## How does SQL work?

SQL works by executing queries on a database. A query is a request for data or information from a database table or combination of tables.

## How does SELECT query work in background?

When you execute a SELECT query, the database engine first parses the query and then executes it. The database engine uses the query optimizer to determine the most efficient way to execute the query.

### What is query parse?

- Query parse is a process of breaking down a query into its components.

### What is query optimizer?

- Query optimizer is a part of the database engine that determines the most efficient way to execute a query.

### What is query execution plan?

- Query execution plan is a plan that shows how the database engine will execute a query.
