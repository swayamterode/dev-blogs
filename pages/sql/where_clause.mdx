# WHERE Caluse in SQL

In SQL, the **WHERE clause** is used to **filter records**. The WHERE clause is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.

The WHERE clause is not only used in the SELECT statement, but it is also used in the UPDATE, DELETE statement, etc., which we will discuss in the upcoming chapters.

## Syntax

The basic syntax of the WHERE clause is as follows:

```sql filename="example.sql"
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

## Example

```sql filename="example.sql"
CREATE DATABASE restaurant;
USE restaurant;

CREATE TABLE info (
name VARCHAR(50),
state VARCHAR(50),
pincode INT
);

INSERT INTO info (name, state, pincode)
VALUES
("KCF", "Maharashtra", 442917), ("Ranwara","Gujrat", 442918), ("Hotel Raj","Tamil Nadu", 441119);

SELECT * from info;

SELECT *from info WHERE STATE = "Maharashtra";
```

In the above example, we have created a table named info and inserted some records into it. We have used the WHERE clause to filter the records where the state is Maharashtra.

## Output

| name | state       | pincode |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| KCF  | Maharashtra | 442917  |

In the output, we can see that only the record with the state Maharashtra is displayed.
