# Datatypes in SQL

Datatypes are used to define the type of data that a column can hold in a table. SQL supports a wide range of datatypes, which can be broadly classified into the following categories:

1. Numeric Datatypes
2. Character Datatypes
3. Date and Time Datatypes
4. Binary Datatypes
5. Miscellaneous Datatypes

Let's take a look at each of these categories in detail.

## 1. Numeric Datatypes

Numeric datatypes are used to store numeric values. The following are some of the commonly used numeric datatypes in SQL:

- `INT`: Used to store integer values.
- `DECIMAL(p, s)`: Used to store fixed-point numbers with `p` digits in total, `s` of which are after the decimal point.
- `FLOAT(p)`: Used to store floating-point numbers with `p` digits of precision.
- `REAL`: Used to store floating-point numbers with single precision.
- `DOUBLE PRECISION`: Used to store floating-point numbers with double precision.

## 2. Character Datatypes

Character datatypes are used to store character strings. The following are some of the commonly used character datatypes in SQL:

- `CHAR(n)`: Used to store fixed-length character strings of length `n`.
- `VARCHAR(n)`: Used to store variable-length character strings of maximum length `n`.
- `TEXT`: Used to store large character strings.

## 3. Date and Time Datatypes

Date and time datatypes are used to store date and time values. The following are some of the commonly used date and time datatypes in SQL:

- `DATE`: Used to store date values in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `TIME`: Used to store time values in the format `HH:MM:SS`.
- `TIMESTAMP`: Used to store date and time values in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`.

## 4. Binary Datatypes

Binary datatypes are used to store binary data. The following are some of the commonly used binary datatypes in SQL:

- `BINARY(n)`: Used to store fixed-length binary data of length `n`. Ex: `BINARY(16)` for storing UUID.
- `VARBINARY(n)`: Used to store variable-length binary data of maximum length `n`. Ex: `VARBINARY(255)` for storing images.
- `BLOB`: Used to store large binary data. Ex: `BLOB` for storing files.

## 5. Miscellaneous Datatypes

There are several other datatypes that are used for specific purposes. Some of the commonly used miscellaneous datatypes in SQL are:

- `BOOLEAN`: Used to store boolean values (`TRUE` or `FALSE`).
- `ENUM`: Used to store one of a predefined list of values.
- `SET`: Used to store a set of values chosen from a predefined list.
