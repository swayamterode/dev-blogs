# Delete Query

Delete query is used to delete rows from a table based on a condition.

Let's create a table named `info` with columns `name` and `rollnumber`.

```sql filename="delete_query.sql"
CREATE TABLE info (
name VARCHAR(50),
rollnumber INT PRIMARY KEY
);

-- INSERT values into the table
INSERT INTO info (name, rollnumber)
VALUES
("Swayam", 1), ("Raj",2), ("Raj", 3);
```

Now let's see all the rows in the table.

```sql filename="select_query.sql"
SELECT * FROM info;
```

Output:

| name   | rollnumber |
| ------ | ---------- |
| Swayam | 1          |
| Raj    | 2          |
| Raj    | 3          |

Now let's delete the row where `name` is `Raj`.

```sql filename="delete_query.sql"
DELETE FROM info WHERE name = "Raj";
```

Now let's see all the rows in the table.

```sql filename="select_query.sql"
SELECT * FROM info;
```

Output:

| name   | rollnumber |
| ------ | ---------- |
| Swayam | 1          |
