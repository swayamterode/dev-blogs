# Update

Update is used to modify the existing records in a table. It is used to update the values of the columns in the table.

Consider this secario, you have ordered food from Zomato and you have given name as Swaym instead of Swayam. Then you can update the name in the database using the `UPDATE` statement.

Most of the time the SQL workbench will give error if you try to update the table values.

To deal with it use`SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES=0;` before updating the table.

```sql

UPDATE customer
SET name="Swayam"
WHERE name="Swaym" AND order_id=1234;
```

<Callout>
  This will update the name of the customer from Swaym to Swayam where the name
  is Swaym and order_id is 1234.
</Callout>
