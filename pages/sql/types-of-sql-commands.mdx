# Types of SQL Commands

SQL commands are instructions used to communicate with a database to perform specific tasks, work, functions, or queries with data. SQL commands can be classified into several categories including:

## DDL (Data Definition Language)

These commands are used to define the structure that holds the data.

For example, `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, and `RENAME` commands.

## DML (Data Manipulation Language)

These commands are used for managing data present in the database.

For example, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` commands.

## DCL (Data Control Language)

These commands are used to control the visibility of data.

For example, `GRANT` and `REVOKE` commands.

## TCL (Transaction Control Language)

These commands are used to manage the changes made by DML statements.

For example, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, and `SAVEPOINT` commands.

## DQL (Data Query Language)

These commands are used to fetch data from the database.
  
For example, `SELECT` command.
