Keys are used to establish relationships between tables in a database. They are used to uniquely identify records in a table and to establish relationships between tables. There are several types of keys in SQL, each with its own purpose.

- Rows in a table are known as `tuple`.
- Columns in a table are known as `attributes`.

Consider the following table `employee`:

| emp_id | emp_name | emp_salary | emp_mobile_number | emp_age |
| ------ | -------- | ---------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| 1      | Alice    | 50000      | 9876543210        | 30      |
| 2      | Bob      | 60000      | 8765432109        | 35      |
| 3      | Charlie  | 70000      | 7654321098        | 40      |

## 1. Primary Key

So according to the above table we can see that `emp_id` is unique for each employee. So, `emp_id` can be used as a **primary key** for the table `employee`.

A primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each record in a table. It must contain **unique** values and **cannot contain `NULL` values**. A table can have only one primary key.

## 2. Foreign Key

Consider the following tables `employee` and `department`:

Employee Table:

| emp_id | emp_name | emp_salary | emp_mobile_number | emp_age |
| ------ | -------- | ---------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| 1      | Alice    | 50000      | 9876543210        | 30      |
| 2      | Bob      | 60000      | 8765432109        | 35      |
| 3      | Charlie  | 70000      | 7654321098        | 40      |

Department Table:

| emp_id | department_name | department_location |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------------- |
| 1      | HR              | New York            |
| 2      | Finance         | London              |
| 3      | IT              | Tokyo               |

In the above table `department`, `emp_id` is a **foreign key**.

<Callout>
  A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that establishes a
  relationship with a primary key in another table. It is used to link two
  tables together.

Here the **employee** table is known as the `Base / Referenced Table` and the **department** table is known as the `Referencing Table`.
