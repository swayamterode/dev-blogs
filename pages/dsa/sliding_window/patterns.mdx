# Sliding Window Patterns

Sliding Window is a technique used to solve problems where we have to find the longest/shortest substring or subarray that satisfies some condition.

It is a very efficient technique that reduces the time complexity of the problem from `O(n^2)` to `O(n)`.

## Identifying Sliding Window Problems

```bash copy
To, find out a sliding window problem :-
> First thing is, we have given something like an "Array" | OR | "String"
> Second thing is, they are talking about either "subsequence" | OR | "substring" | "subarray"
> And third most thing is, either we have given a "window size i.e. k" | OR | we have to "manually find out window size"
```

If you get aleast 2 out of 3 points, then it's a sliding window problem üíØ

## Types of Sliding Window Patterns

1. `Fix size` sliding window means K is given
2. `Variable size` sliding window means K is not given

## Template for `Variable Size` Sliding Window

```cpp copy
while(j < size) {
    if(condition < k) {
        // Increase the window size ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
        j++;
    } else if(condition == k) {
        // Answer Calculation happens here ü´°
        j++;
    } else if(condition > k) {
        while(condition > k) {
            // Decrease the window size ‚¨áÔ∏è
            i++;
        }
        j++;
    }
}
```

- Initially, both `i` and `j` pointers will start form 0.
- The `j` pointer is used to expand the window and the `i` pointer is used to shrink the window.
- The `i` pointer will be used to shrink the window when the condition is greater than `k`.
- The `j` pointer will be used to expand the window when the condition is less than `k`.
