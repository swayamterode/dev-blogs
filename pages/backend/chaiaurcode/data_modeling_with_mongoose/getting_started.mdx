# Getting Started with Mongoose

## Introduction

The first step to create a `model` folder in the `root` of the directory.

The standard structure of the `model` folder is as follows:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="model" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="user.models.js" />
    <FileTree.File name="todo.models.js" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

This is the common structure of the `model` folder. It is the standard practice to name the file as `filename.models.js`.

<Callout>Use either `model.js` or `models.js` as the file name.</Callout>

## Basics of Mongoose

Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. Mongoose supports both promises and callbacks.

Mongoose helps us to create schemas and models for MongoDB collections.

<Steps>

### Import Mongoose

```js
import mongoose from "mongoose";
```

### Create a Schema

```js
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({});
```

With the above code, we have created a schema for the user.

### Export the Model

```js
export default mongoose.model("User", userSchema);
```

> Why do we need to export the model ❓
>
> We need to export the model to use it in other files.

### Mongoose Schema Example

```js showLineNumbers
import mongoose from "mongoose";

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  // Define the schema here
});

export default mongoose.model("User", userSchema);
```

</Steps>

## Interview Question

<Callout type="info">
  How will the model be stored in the database?

The model will be stored in the database as `users`. Mongoose automatically pluralizes the model nameand lowercases it.

## Conclusion

In this article, we learned about the basics of Mongoose and how to create a schema and model using Mongoose.
