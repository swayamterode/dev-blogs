# Introduction

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It is developed and maintained by Microsoft. TypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.

## Features of TypeScript that JavaScript doesn't have

1. **Static Typing**: TypeScript is a statically typed language. It means that you can define the type of a variable like string, number, boolean, etc. at the time of declaration. This helps in catching errors at compile time.

2. **Interfaces**: TypeScript has interfaces. Interfaces are used to define the structure of an object. It is a way to define a contract in your code.

3. **Classes**: TypeScript supports classes. Classes are used to create objects. It is a blueprint for creating objects.

4. **Modules**: TypeScript supports modules. Modules are used to organize the code in a better way. It helps in creating a clean and maintainable code.

5. **Decorators**: TypeScript has decorators. Decorators are used to add metadata to a class, method, or property.

6. **Types**: TypeScript has types. Types are used to define the type of a variable. It helps in catching errors at compile time.

7. **Generics**: TypeScript supports generics. Generics are used to create reusable components.

8. **Namespaces**: TypeScript has namespaces. Namespaces are used to organize the code in a better way.

9. **Enums**: TypeScript supports enums. Enums are used to define a set of named constants.

10. **Mixins**: TypeScript supports mixins. Mixins are used to add functionality to a class.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. It means that existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs. TypeScript adds **static typing to JavaScript**. It helps in catching errors at compile time. It also helps in writing clean and maintainable code.

## How to install TypeScript?

You can install TypeScript using npm. Run the following command to install TypeScript globally:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

To check the version of TypeScript installed, run the following command:

```bash
tsc -v
```

## How to compile TypeScript?

You can compile TypeScript using the `tsc` command. Run the following command to compile a TypeScript file:

```bash
tsc filename.ts
```

This will generate a JavaScript file with the same name as the TypeScript file.
