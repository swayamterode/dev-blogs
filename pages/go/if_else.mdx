# If else in Go

In Go, the `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a condition is true. If the condition is false, the code block is skipped.

## Code

```go showLineNumbers
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	//  if else statement
	fmt.Println("Enter a number: ")
	var num int
	fmt.Scanln(&num)
	if num >=18 {
		fmt.Println("You are eligible to vote")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("You are not eligible to vote")
	}

	//  this is a short statement
	if age:=18; age<60 {
		fmt.Println("You are in the working age group")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("You are not in the working age group")
	}
	// this is a short statement
	if num:=10; num%2==0 {
		fmt.Println("Even number")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Odd number")
	}
}
```

## Output

```text
Enter a number:
20
You are eligible to vote
You are in the working age group
Even number
```

## Explanation

### If-Else Statement

```go showLineNumbers
fmt.Println("Enter a number: ")
var num int
fmt.Scanln(&num)
if num >= 18 {
    fmt.Println("You are eligible to vote")
} else {
    fmt.Println("You are not eligible to vote")
}
```

- Prompts the user to enter a number and reads it into the variable num.
- Checks if the entered number is greater than or equal to `18`.
- Prints **You are eligible to vote** if the condition is true; otherwise, prints **You are not eligible to vote.**

### If Statement with a Short Variable Declaration

```go showLineNumbers
if age := 18; age < 60 {
fmt.Println("You are in the working age group")
} else {
fmt.Println("You are not in the working age group")
}
```

- Declares and initializes age to `18` within the if statement.
- Checks if age is less than `60`.
- Prints **You are in the working age group** if true; otherwise, prints **You are not in the working age group.**
- If Statement with a Short Variable Declaration and Modulo Operation:

```go showLineNumbers
if num := 10; num%2 == 0 {
fmt.Println("Even number")
} else {
fmt.Println("Odd number")
}
```

- Declares and initializes num to 10 within the if statement.
- Checks if num is even by evaluating the condition `num % 2 == 0`.
- Prints `Even number` if **true**; otherwise, prints `Odd number.`
