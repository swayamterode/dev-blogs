# Hello World

Let's write our first program in Go.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

## How to Build?

To build the program, run the following command:

```bash
go build hello.go
```

<Callout>
  The above command will create an executable file named `hello`
</Callout>

## How to Run?

To run the program, execute the following command:

```bash
./hello
```

## Efficient way to run the code

You can also run the code without creating an executable file. To do so, run the following command:

```bash
go run hello.go
```

<Callout>The above command will compile and run the code in one step.</Callout>
