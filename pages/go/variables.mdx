# Variables in Go

Variables are used to store data in a program. In Go, variables are declared using the `var` keyword. The syntax for declaring a variable is:

<Callout type="info">
  We dont use `const` keyword to declare a variable in Go. We use `var` keyword
  to declare a variable.
</Callout>

```go showLineNumbers filename="variables.go"
package main

import "fmt"

// Declaring a variable
func main() {
	// One way to declare a variable
	var name string = "Swayam"
	fmt.Println(name)

	// Short hand declaration
	sirName := "Terode"
	fmt.Println(sirName)

	// Multiple variable declaration
	var (
		age int = 21
		year int = 2021
	)
	fmt.Println(age, year)

	// Multiple variable declaration with short hand
	var (
		roll int = 1
		branch string = "IT"
	)
	fmt.Println(roll, branch)

	// Declaring multiple variables with short hand
	rollNo, branchName := 1, "IT"
	fmt.Println(rollNo, branchName)

	// Declaring a variable with no value
	var address string
	address = "Pune"
	fmt.Println("\nAddress: ",address)
}
```

## Let's break down the code

### Declaring a variable

```go
// One way to declare a variable
var name string = "Swayam"
fmt.Println(name)
```

- `var name string = "Swayam"`: This is the syntax to declare a variable in Go. Here, `name` is the variable name, `string` is the data type of the variable, and `"Swayam"` is the value assigned to the variable.

### Short hand declaration

```go
// Short hand declaration
sirName := "Terode"
fmt.Println(sirName)
```

- `sirName := "Terode"`: This is the short-hand declaration of a variable in Go. Here, `sirName` is the variable name, and `"Terode"` is the value assigned to the variable. The data type of the variable is inferred from the value assigned to it.

### Multiple variable declaration

```go
// Multiple variable declaration
var (
    age int = 21
    year int = 2021
)
fmt.Println(age, year)
```

- `var ( ... )`: This is the syntax to declare multiple variables in Go. Here, `age` and `year` are the variable names, `int` is the data type of the variables, and `21` and `2021` are the values assigned to the variables.

### Multiple variable declaration with short hand

```go
// Declaring multiple variables with short hand
rollNo, branchName := 1, "IT"
fmt.Println(rollNo, branchName)
```

- `rollNo, branchName := 1, "IT"`: This is the short-hand declaration of multiple variables in Go. Here, `rollNo` and `branchName` are the variable names, and `1` and `"IT"` are the values assigned to the variables. The data types of the variables are inferred from the values assigned to them.

### Declaring a variable with no value

```go
// Declaring a variable with no value
var address string
address = "Pune"
fmt.Println("\nAddress: ",address)
```

- `var address string`: This is the syntax to declare a variable in Go without assigning a value to it. Here, `address` is the variable name, and `string` is the data type of the variable.

## Output

```bash
Swayam
Terode
21 2021
1 IT
1 IT

Address:  Pune
```
