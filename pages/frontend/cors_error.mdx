# CORS Error in React Vite

When you are trying to make a request to an API from your React application. You might encounter the CORS error which says something like `CORS policy : No Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is present on the requested resource.

## Problem

When you are trying to make a request to an API from your React application, you might encounter the following error:

<Callout type="error">
    Access to fetch at `http://localhost:3000/api` from origin
    `http://localhost:3001` has been blocked by CORS policy: No
    **Access-Control-Allow-Origin** header is present on the requested resource.
    If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors'
    to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.

</Callout>

## Solution

To fix the CORS error, you need to add the following code in the `vite.config.js` file.

```jsx copy showLineNumbers {(6, 7, 8, 9, 10)} filename="vite.config.js"
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    proxy: {
      "/api": "http://localhost:3000",
    },
  },
  plugins: [react()],
});
```

## Explanation

In the above code, we are using the `server` option to define a proxy for the API. The `proxy` option is an object that maps the path to the target URL. In this case, we are mapping the path `/api` to the target URL `http://localhost:3000`.

By using the proxy option, we are telling Vite to forward all requests to `/api` to `http://localhost:3000`. This way, the API request will be made from the same origin, and the CORS error will be fixed.

## Summary

By adding the proxy option in the `vite.config.js` file, you can fix the CORS error when making API requests from your React application.

For more information, you can refer to the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options#server-proxy).
